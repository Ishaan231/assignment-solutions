Fundamentals of Java Assignment Solutions




1.What is programming language?
Ans. A programming language is a formal system of rules and syntax used to write computer programs and give instructions to a computer. It provides a means for humans to communicate with computers, specifying the logic and tasks that the computer should perform. Programming languages can vary widely in their complexity and purpose, from high-level languages like Python and Java to low-level languages like C and assembly language, each serving specific needs in software development.


2.Why do we need a Programming language?
Ans. Programming languages are necessary because they act as a bridge between humans and computers. They enable us to communicate instructions to computers in a way that is both understandable and precise. Without programming languages, it would be incredibly challenging and time-consuming to create software, automate tasks, and solve complex problems. These languages make it possible to harness the full power of computers, drive innovation, and improve various aspects of our lives through technology.


3.What are the features of java?
Ans. Java is a popular and versatile programming language known for its features:


1. Platform Independence:Java programs can run on different platforms without modification.


2. Object-Oriented: It follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, making code modular and easier to maintain.


3. Robust: Java has built-in error checking, which helps prevent many common programming mistakes.


4. Automatic Memory Management: It handles memory management, reducing the risk of memory leaks.


5. Rich Standard Library: Java offers a comprehensive library of pre-written code for various tasks.


6. Security: Java provides a secure execution environment, reducing the risk of malware and other security vulnerabilities.


7. Multithreading: Java supports concurrent execution, enabling programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.


8. Ease of Learning: It has a straightforward syntax, making it accessible for beginners.


9. Community and Ecosystem: A large and active community supports Java, with a wealth of resources and tools available.




4.What is an object?
Ans. An object in Java is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities. In Java, an object is a fundamental instance of a class. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, defining their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Objects hold data, which can be accessed and modified through methods defined in the class. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as “circle”, “square”, and “menu”.Objects in Java enable the organization and manipulation of data and functionality in a structured manner.


5.What is a class?
Ans. A class in Java is a set of objects which shares common characteristics/ behavior and common properties/ attributes. It is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. For example, Student is a class while a particular student named Ravi is an object.


Properties of Java Classes
* Class is not a real-world entity. It is just a template or blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
* Class does not occupy memory.
* Class is a group of variables of different data types and a group of methods.
* A Class in Java can contain:
* Data member
* Method
* Constructor
* Nested Class




6. Explain about the main() method in java.
Ans. The ‘main()’ method in Java is a crucial part of every Java application. It serves as the entry point for the program, where execution begins. When you run a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for the ‘main()’ method and starts executing the code inside it. This method is where you define the initial tasks and logic for your program. It must have a specific signature and acts as the starting point for your Java application, allowing you to control the flow of your program from there.
