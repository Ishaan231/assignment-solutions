  1.What is statically typed and Dynamically  typed programming language?
  Ans. Statically typed and dynamically typed refer to the way programming languages handle variable types. In a statically typed language, variable types are explicitly declared at compile-time, which means that the compiler checks for type compatibility before the program runs. This early type checking can catch errors at compile-time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors related to variable types. Common statically typed languages include Java, C++, and Swift.
                          On the other hand, dynamically typed languages do not require explicit type declarations during compilation. Instead, variable types are determined at runtime, allowing for more flexibility but potentially leading to runtime errors if a variable is used in a way inconsistent with its type. Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.
           The choice between static and dynamic typing often depends on the goals of a project. Statically typed languages can provide greater safety and performance optimizations, especially in large codebases. Dynamically typed languages, while more flexible and concise, may sacrifice some of the safety nets offered by static typing in favor of quicker development and easier code maintenance. Ultimately, the decision between static and dynamic typing reflects a trade-off between early error detection


2.What is the variable in java?
Ans. In Java, a variable is a named storage location that holds data during the program's execution. Variables have a data type, such as int or String, determining the kind of values they can store. They are declared using keywords like "int" or "String" and can be assigned values using the "=" operator. Variable values can change during the program's execution.


3.How to assign a value to variable?
Ans. In Java, assigning a value to a variable involves declaring the variable type, specifying its name, and using the assignment operator to assign a value. For instance, to assign the integer value 10 to a variable named 'x', you would write int 'x = 10';. Here, "int" is the data type, "x" is the variable name, and "10" is the assigned value. This establishes a memory location for the variable "x" with an initial value of 10, ready for use in your Java program.


4.What are primitive data types in java?
Ans. In Java, primitive data types are basic data types that represent simple values. They are not objects and do not have methods. The primitive data types in Java are:
* byte: 8-bit signed integer.
* short: 16-bit signed integer.
* int: 32-bit signed integer.
* long: 64-bit signed integer.
* float: 32-bit floating-point number.
* double: 64-bit floating-point number.
* char: 16-bit Unicode character.
* boolean: Represents true or false.
These primitive data types are used to store simple values efficiently in memory and are often used as the building blocks for more complex data structures in Java programs.


5. What are the identifiers in java?
Ans. In Java, identifiers serve as names for various program elements such as classes, variables, methods, and labels. These names follow specific rules to ensure consistency and clarity in code. Identifiers must begin with a letter (either uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_), and subsequent characters can include letters, digits, or underscores. Java identifiers are case-sensitive, distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase letters. Additionally, identifiers cannot contain spaces or special characters, with the exception of the underscore. They also cannot be Java reserved keywords, as those are reserved for language constructs. While there is no specific length limitation for identifiers, it is generally advisable to choose names that are meaningful and concise to enhance code readability and maintainability. Adhering to these identifier naming conventions contributes to the creation of well-structured and easily understandable Java programs.


6. List the operators in java?
Ans.    - ! (Logical NOT)


4. *Bitwise Operators:*
   - & (Bitwise AND)
   - | (Bitwise OR)
   - ^ (Bitwise XOR)
   - ~ (Bitwise NOT)
   - << (Left shift)
   - >> (Right shift)
   - >>> (Unsigned right shift)


5. *Assignment Operators:*
   - = (Assignment)
   - += (Addition assignment)
   - -= (Subtraction assignment)
   - *= (Multiplication assignment)
   - /= (Division assignment)
   - %= (Modulus assignment)
   - &= (Bitwise AND assignment)
   - |= (Bitwise OR assignment)
   - ^= (Bitwise XOR assignment)
   - <<= (Left shift assignment)
   - >>= (Right shift assignment)
   - >>>= (Unsigned right shift assignment)


6. *Increment and Decrement Operators:*
   - ++ (Increment)
   - -- (Decrement)


7. *Conditional (Ternary) Operator:*
   - ? : (Conditional)


8. *Instanceof Operator:*
   - instanceof (Used for object type comparison)


These operators are fundamental building blocks for expressing computations and conditions in Java programs.


7. Explain about increment and decrement operators and given an example.
Ans. Increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1, respectively. These operators are often employed in loops and other situations where you need to update a variable's value by a fixed amount.


Increment Operator (++):


Increases the value of a variable by 1.
Can be used as a prefix (++i) or postfix (i++) operator.
The prefix form increments the value before its use in an expression, while the postfix form increments the value after its use in an expression.
int i = 5;
int result = ++i;  // Prefix increment: i is incremented to 6 before its value is used.
System.out.println(result);  // Output: 6


int j = 5;
int resultPost = j++;  // Postfix increment: j is used first (resultPost gets 5), then j is incremented to 6.
System.out.println(resultPost);  // Output: 5


Decrement Operator (--):


Decreases the value of a variable by 1.
Like the increment operator, it can be used as a prefix (--i) or postfix (i--) operator.
int x = 8;
int resultDecrement = --x;  // Prefix decrement: x is decremented to 7 before its value is used.
System.out.println(resultDecrement);  // Output: 7


int y = 8;
int resultPostDecrement = y--;  // Postfix decrement: y is used first (resultPostDecrement gets 8), then y is decremented to 7.
System.out.println(resultPostDecrement);  // Output: 8


Increment and decrement operators are convenient shortcuts for updating variables by a fixed amount and are commonly used in control structures like loops.
